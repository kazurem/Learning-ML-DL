# Learning-ML-DL
A respository I am making in order to learn ML and DL.

### Goals:
1. Create famous ML algorithms from scratch (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc)
2. Create a full neural network (both forward and backpropagation) from scratch
3. Basic DL projects using TensorFlow

### Progress:
1. Recreating famous ML algorithms:
    i.      Linear Regression using Gradient Descent (Done)
    ii.     Losgistic Regression for Binary Classification (Done)
    iii.    SVM (Not Done)
    iv.     Naive Bayes (Not Done)
    v.      Decision Trees (Not Done)
    vi.     Gradient Boosting (Not Done)
    vii.    Random Forest (Not Done)
    viii.   XGBoost (Not Done)
    ix.     DBSCAN (Not Done)
    x.      K-means Clustering (Not Done)
    xi.     PCA (Not Done)

2. Creating a neural network from scratch  (In progress. Can't seem to get the size of matrices right.)
3. Basic DL projects using TensorFlow
    i.   MNIST multiclass and binary classification (Done)
    ii.  Linear regression using NN (Done)
    iii. Binary Classification using NN (Done)
